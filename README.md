Lumea. Read less. Understand more. Treat faster.

A doctor spends more time handling administrative work than treating patients.
Lumea changes this reality by summarizing each clinical file in seconds.
The time saved becomes care, and care becomes faster.
More patients seen, shorter waiting times, more lives protected.

Market Overview : 

The European digital health market exceeds approximately €120 billion and is growing at 10–12% annually.
France alone represents roughly €15 billion.
Europe counts more than 2 million doctors (including approximately 250,000 in France), all facing a massive and accelerating documentation burden.

The Core Bottleneck

Physicians spend approximately 25% of their time on:
-laboratory results
-imaging reports
-clinical notes and summaries
-prescriptions
-hospital discharge summaries
-the shared medical file (DMP)
-internal messaging and administrative exchanges

Document review accounts for 40–50% of total clinical time.

Yet no tool provides a reliable, structured synthesis of this workflow.

Lumea targets the number one bottleneck in daily clinical practice:
“Read less, understand faster, see more patients.”

Product Overview

Lumea is an AI-native tool that turns a chaotic patient record into a clear clinical brief in seconds.
It extracts, organizes, and summarizes information to save doctors time.

How Lumea Works : 

1. Upload
 The doctor uploads PDFs (labs, imaging, notes, discharge summaries).
2. Ingestion & Indexing
Gemini File Search parses, OCRs, and indexes every document.
3. Extraction (No medical interpretation)
Gemini 2.5 Flash detects new information, changes, and key elements across the patient’s history.
4. 5-Line Clinical Summary
 Lumea condenses the essential updates into a five-line longitudinal summary.
5. Consultation Note Draft
 A raw structured note is generated to prepare the appointment.
6. 20-Second Audio Brief
 ElevenLabs produces a short spoken recap for rapid pre-consultation review.
7. Structured Storage
 Supabase stores all outputs for fast retrieval at the next visit.

We are AI-native

Lumea runs as an autonomous pipeline: ingest → index → extract → summarize → audio brief → store.
No human intervention is needed.
The entire system can be maintained by a single engineer.

ROI for Doctors

The ROI is immediate, measurable, and substantial.

1. Direct Time Savings
Average of 20 minutes saved per patient encounter.
For a physician seeing 20 patients per day:
 160 to 400 minutes saved per day
 = 2h40 to 6h40 of cognitive load eliminated.
2. Increased Throughput / Reduced Waiting Time
+3 to +8 additional patients per day without increasing clinical effort
 = +15–40 per week
 = +60–160 per month.
3. Direct Economic ROI
For general practitioners or specialists:
+3 patients/day → +€1,200/week (~€5,000/month)
+8 patients/day → +€3,200/week (~€13,000/month)
Cost of Lumea: €49/month → ROI between x100 and x200.
4. Reduced Cognitive Burden
Less administrative fatigue
Reduced risk of oversight
More focused consultations → improved care quality.
5. Organizational Impact
Smoother scheduling
Fewer delays between patients
Better comprehension of patient history → faster clinical decisions.
6. Overall ROI Summary
Administrative time reduced: ~50%.
Productivity increased: +20% to +40%.
Additional clinical revenue: €5,000–€13,000/month.
Lumea cost: €49/month → instant ROI for them.

Go-To-Market Strategy

Lumea enters the market through individual doctors, who adopt the tool because it instantly saves them 2–6 hours per day.
Once a doctor uses Lumea, the entire practice typically follows, creating a natural expansion loop (1 doctor → 5–10 users).
As adoption grows within clinics, Lumea becomes the default workflow for documentation review.
In a second phase, hospitals and large medical groups integrate Lumea to standardize processes and reduce workload.
The product spreads organically through real clinical value — no sales force required.

Final Summary

The European digital health market exceeds €120 billion, with more than 2 million doctors facing increasing documentation overload.
Document review alone consumes approximately 20 minutes per patient, making it the primary clinical bottleneck.
Lumea removes this constraint by generating a longitudinal clinical summary in 10 seconds, enabling physicians to save 2-6 hours per day, see 3 to 8 more patients, and achieve an ROI of more than 100× for a €49/month subscription.

With Lumea, doctors read less, understand more and treat faster !
